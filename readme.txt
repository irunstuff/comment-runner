== Description ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Comment Runner work? =

Comment Runner checks WordPress comments for HTML hyperlinks.
If one is found, the comment is placed in your comment-"trash" folder.
This technique is effective because it denies spammers what they're after -- an SEO advantage through hyperlinks and lead generation through email.

Additionally, Comment Runner hides the author-URL input box.
And because this field isn't visible to a reader of the blog, any comment that includes data in this field is presumed to be spam and marked as "trash."
